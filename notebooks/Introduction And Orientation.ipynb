    "# Introduction And Orientation\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook outlines the provided notebooks, the file system structure and the relationship to the google cloud bucket store. \n",
    "\n",
    "We provide a number of reference notebooks in the reference-notebooks sub directory.\n",
    "These are read only and will be recreated when the users notebook server is restarted.\n",
    "To change these notebooks it si recommended to make a copy of them in another directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Refine Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The following notebooks import data from the upload bucket, refine it and store it in the sources bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the data is processed further. For example, the aircraft fleet data is extracted from the FR24 flight data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Import And Process CPR And FR24 Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Imports, refines and merges CPR and FR24 input data files.\n",

    "\n",
    "Imports, refines and merges CPR and FR24 input data files over a range of dates.\n",

    "### Import APDS Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Imports and  refines an APDS input data file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analyse and Interpolate Trajectory Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "Analyses and interpolates trajectory positions files from the sources bucket.\n",
    "The files are ususally created by the Import And Process CPR And FR24 Data notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fleet Data Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Imports data from fleet data files into the reference database.\n",

    "### Find Trajectory Intersections\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialises the airspace database and finds: sector, airport and user defined intersections.\n",

    "\n",
    "Reads a trajectory from a positions file containing many trajectories.\n",
    "Visualises a single  trajectories Latitude and Longitude positions on a Leaflet chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualise Trajectory Profiles\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualises a trajectories positions an dreived horizontal path on a Leaflet chart.\n",
    "Also charts the vertical profile and speed profiles, both before and after smoothing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Compare Flight Positions\n",
    "\n",
    "Compares the trajectories positions from the positions files of two flights.\n",
    "Originally written to compare data logger positions with the smoothed trajectory.\n",

    "### List a Bucket \n",
    "\n",
    "This section shows how the semantics of bucket operations can be surprising.  \n",
    "A bucket only contains named things, a name like a/b.txt is really only a string.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For example to list the contents of the 'sources/apds' bucket:"
